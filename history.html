 <h1> Behind the Story</h1>
<main> 
    

    <h2> Inspiration</h2>
    <p> The story of <b><em>The Adventure of Bella, Max, and Coco</em></b> was created as a simple, playful tale to teach kids about the importance of teamwork, friendship, and sharing. The idea came from imagining three very different animals—a bunny, a squirrel, and a bird—each with their own special skills, and how they might work together to solve a problem</p>

    <h2> How It Was Written </h2>
    <p> This story began as a simple idea for a children’s tale, then was expanded into a wiki project to show how a story can be turned into a whole world of characters, settings, and lessons. It was written with clear language and playful details so kids (and parents!) could enjoy it together.</p>
