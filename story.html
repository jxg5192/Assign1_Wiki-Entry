  <h1>Into the Forest: The Story</h1>

  <main>
    <h3><em>Once upon a time…</em></h3>

    <p>In a bright green meadow lived <em>Bella the Bunny</em>, <em>Max the Squirrel</em>, and <em>Coco the Bluebird</em>. They were the best of friends and loved exploring together.</p>

    <p>One sunny morning, Bella hopped up and said,</p>
    <blockquote class="hidden-quote">“Let’s go find the biggest, juiciest berry in the forest!”</blockquote>

    <p>Max’s tail twitched with excitement.</p>
    <blockquote class="hidden-quote">“I bet I can climb the tallest tree to spot it first!” he chattered.</blockquote>

    <p>Coco flapped her wings happily.</p>
    <blockquote class="hidden-quote">“And I can fly above to guide us from the sky!”</blockquote>

    <p>Off they went—Bella hopping, Max scurrying, and Coco soaring. After a while, Coco spotted something shiny red near a bush.</p>
    <blockquote class="hidden-quote">“Look down there!” she chirped.</blockquote>

    <p>Bella sniffed the air.</p>
    <blockquote class="hidden-quote">“Mmm, I smell berries!”</blockquote>

    <p>But when they reached the bush, the berries were too high for Bella and too far for Max to reach. Together, they thought of a plan:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><em>Bella</em> stacked some smooth stones to make a little step.</li>
      <li><em>Max</em> climbed onto Bella’s back.</li>
      <li><em>Coco</em> fluttered down to steady the branch.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>With teamwork, they plucked the biggest, juiciest berry they had ever seen!</p>
    <p>They split it into three pieces and shared it under the shade of a tree.</p>
    <blockquote class="hidden-quote">“This berry is sweeter because we worked together,” Bella said.</blockquote>

    <p>And from that day on, the three friends knew that with teamwork, no adventure was too big.</p>

    <h3><em>The End!</em></h3>
