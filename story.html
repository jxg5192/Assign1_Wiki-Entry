        <h1> The Adventure of Bella, Max, and Coco </h1>
        <p> <h3> <i> Once upon a time... </i> </h3> in a bright green meadow, lived <i>Bella the Bunny</i>, <i>Max the Squirrel</i>, and <i>Coco the Bluebird</i>. They were the best of friends and loved exploring together.</p> 
        <p> One sunny morning, Bella hopped up and said,</p>
        <blockquote> <i> “Let’s go find the biggest, juiciest berry in the forest!”</i></blockquote>
        <p> Max’s tail twitched with excitement.</p>
        <blockquote> <i> “I bet I can climb the tallest tree to spot it first!”</i> he chattered.</blockquote>
        <p> Coco flapped her wings happily.</p>
        <blockquote> <i> “And I can fly above to guide us from the sky!”</i></blockquote>
        <p> Off they went—Bella hopping, Max scurrying, and Coco soaring. After a while, Coco spotted something shiny red near a bush.</p>
        <blockquote> <i> “Look down there!”</i> she chirped.</blockquote>
        <p> Bella sniffed the air.</p>
        <blockquote> <i>“Mmm, I smell berries!”</i></blockquote>
        <p> But when they reached the bush, the berries were too high for Bella and too far for Max to reach. Together, they thought of a plan:</p>
        <p> 
            <ol> 
                <li> <i>Bella stacked some smooth stones to make a little step.</i></li>
                <li><i>Max climbed onto Bella’s back.</i></li>
                <li><i>Coco fluttered down to steady the branch.</i></li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p> With teamwork, they plucked the biggest, juiciest berry they had ever seen!</p>
        <p> They split it into three pieces and shared it under the shade of a tree.</p>
        <blockquote> <i> “This berry is sweeter because we worked together,”</i> Bella said.</blockquote>
        <p> And from that day on, the three friends knew that with teamwork, no adventure was too big.</p>
        <p> <h3> <i> The End! </i> </h3>
